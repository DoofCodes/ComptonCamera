# 📸 Compton Camera Simulation Project 🌈

Welcome to the **Compton Camera Simulation Project**! This project is all about simulating Compton Cameras 📸, 🚀 aiming to obtain a dataset for the image reconstruction algorithm. We will be leveraging various tools to simulate the scattering and absorption of photons✨ within a compton camera, making strides towards innovative image reconstruction techniques. 🌠

Whether we dive into the data pre-processing part of image reconstruction will depend on the intriguing paths our exploration takes us. Stay tuned! 💫

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate the operational aspects of Compton Cameras, understand the physics behind them, and generate a dataset that can be used for image reconstruction purposes. This effort is crucial for advancing research in medical imaging🏥, astrophysics🛰️, and other fields where precise imaging from scattered photons is vital. 🛸

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Here's a sneak peek into some of the tools and technologies we're using:

- MATLAB 🧮
- Python with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib 🐍
- [any other tools or software we may use]

## 📚 Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoofCodes/ComptonCamera.git
cd Matlab_scripts
```
## 📈 Simulation Process

- **Initialization**: Set up the simulation environment, defining parameters such as energy levels, scattering angles, and more. 🎲
- **Simulation**: Run the simulation scripts to model photon interactions within the Compton Camera. 🔬
- **Data Generation**: Collect and organize the data from simulations for further analysis. 📊
- **Image Reconstruction**: [Optional] Apply image reconstruction algorithms to the generated dataset. 🎨


## 🔄 Data Pre-processing [Optional]

Depending on the outcomes of our simulations, we might embark on pre-processing the generated data to prepare it for image reconstruction. This could involve noise reduction, normalization, and other techniques to enhance the quality of our dataset. 🔧
